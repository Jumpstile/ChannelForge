# Blocker #2 contract artifact

This directory is the stable repository artifact for the accepted Blocker #2 design. It is design/review evidence only. It authorizes no implementation, branch, pull request, merge, deployment, or release decision.

The source contract is the published standalone contract in GitHub issue #60, comment 5410735336. PART-A, PART-B, and PART-C are verbatim section moves from that contract; the contract wording is not rewritten. SYMBOL-CLOSURE.md contains only the nine known closure definitions requested after architectural acceptance.

## File map

- [PART-A-canonical-foundation.md](./PART-A-canonical-foundation.md) — authority, paths, canonical bytes, domains, source identity, and safe text.
- [PART-B-semantic-schemas.md](./PART-B-semantic-schemas.md) — M3U, XMLTV, candidate, review, decision, and accepted-state projections.
- [PART-C-promotion-recovery.md](./PART-C-promotion-recovery.md) — immutable promotion, journal protocol, recovery classification, fault hooks, and tests.
- [SYMBOL-CLOSURE.md](./SYMBOL-CLOSURE.md) — the additive closure definitions and the validation inventory.

The three contract parts are read together. A later part cannot weaken an earlier definition. The closure document is normative only for the symbols it defines; it does not redesign or regenerate the contract.

## Symbol-closure rule

Every referenced hash domain, enum, schema, property order, projection, and recovery classification must have exactly one definition across this directory. Duplicate definitions are invalid, and an unresolved reference is invalid. The closure inventory at the end of SYMBOL-CLOSURE.md is the review checklist for this rule.

## Scope boundary

No product implementation, database, scheduler, GUI, provider adapter, NAS behavior, or release certification is included in this artifact.

## Governance and freeze control

Accountable owner: ChannelForge Product Owner. The owner is accountable for contract scope, reviewer coordination, supersession, and freeze approval.

Approver: ChannelForge Architecture Authority. The approver grants architecture acceptance and freeze approval after the required technical, adversarial, and governance reviews are complete.

Canonical artifact location: docs/adr/blocker-2-contract/. The contract revision identifier is ContractRevisionId = blocker-2-contract/v1. This identifier denotes the exact five-file v1 contents at the canonical artifact location; a branch name, draft, or working-tree state is not a revision identifier.

The supersession and change-control authority is the Accountable Contract Owner acting with the Approver. Any proposed change must identify the prior ContractRevisionId, describe the targeted delta, and produce a new versioned revision. No amendment may silently modify a frozen revision.

The mandatory review sequence is ordered as follows:

1. Technical preservation review confirms that the accepted technical content is preserved and that any delta is bounded.
2. Adversarial review checks determinism, safety, recovery, and unresolved contract gaps.
3. Governance review confirms ownership, scope, authority, and change-control compliance.
4. Architecture acceptance approves the complete versioned revision.
5. Freeze approval records the ContractRevisionId, Accountable Contract Owner, reviewers, approval results, and approval date.

Implementation is unblocked only when a versioned contract revision exists, all required reviewers have approved it, freeze approval is recorded, and the frozen ContractRevisionId is referenced by the implementation work. Any contract modification after freeze automatically invalidates the freeze and requires the review sequence and freeze approval to run again for the new revision.

Every implementation or release work item must reference the frozen ContractRevisionId. Implementation is prohibited against a draft, a superseded revision, or an amendment that has not completed the required approvals and freeze. This governance artifact remains review evidence only and is not release certification or release evidence.
